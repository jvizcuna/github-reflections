What new skills have you learned?
I have always been very afraid of having to start a website from scratch since I do not know all the terms used by the developers, but this program has undoubtedly helped me to start in a friendly way and with the best reward of eventually forming myself as a web developer and who knows if you can work for Google in the future :).

What has been easy?
I think for me wasn't 100% easy since There were terms which was I wasn't familiar but all the resources like "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" are definitely a good resource to have and finish all these first lessons.

What has been difficult?
More than difficult I think was a "bug" on my udacity progress. When I finish for the first time the Lesson3 I log out and when I log in few minutes later I notices that I lost half of my progress. Thank good I saved all the index.html files for each one fo those and just did them again. I actually ask to the community in Slack but nobody answer.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Those solving strategies are definitely an excellent resource to understand a little bit more every step, and I'm sure I'll be continue using them for any future question or doubt about my projects.
